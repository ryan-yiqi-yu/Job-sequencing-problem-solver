# CS 170 Project Fall 2021

Requirements:

Python 3.6+

Files:
- `parse.py`: functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: contains the solution to solve for all the outputs
- `Task.py`: contains a class that is useful for processing inputs

Precise instructions on how to run the solution algorithm:
1. The solution solver is contained in the solver.py file, therefore
in order to run the solution, you must be in the same directory.
2. In order for solver to run on the input files, there must be a folder
in its directory called 'inputs/'. Inside this folder, there must be
three sub-folders called 'small', 'medium', and 'large', where the respective
small medium and large '.in' files must be stored.
3. Create a folder 'outputs/' to hold outputs. Inside the outputs folder,
create a small/medium/large sub-folder. Output folders must be created in
order for the solution to run.
4. Once in the same directory as solver.py, run 'python3 solver.py'.
5. This command should run the solution on the given inputs and create outputs.
6. Wait for the program to finish running and you're finished.
